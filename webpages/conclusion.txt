<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<ul>
<li>Cellular automata can be used to simulate the spatial structure of urban land use over time.</li>
<li>Fractal structures are observed for the urbanized area.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fractal dimensions found in the model were in agreement with fractal dimensions in the real world.</li>
<li>By varying &alpha; the randomness and the formation of clusters in the model can be controlled.</li>
<li>Local interactions are mostly sufficient for emergent behaviour. Smaller neighbourhood sizes than initially expected were sufficient.</li>
<li>The city size distribution follows a power law distribution.</li>
<li>The model can be extended, for example by adding a river.</li>
</ul>
