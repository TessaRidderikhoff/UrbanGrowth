<p><strong>Alpha parameter exper</strong><strong>iment</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alpha determens if there is randomness in the model. This means that a cell that does not have the highest potential can still be selected to change. In this way randomness comes into the model.</p>
<p>When alpha is for example 0 there is no randomness in the model. There are only large blocks with the same kind. When apha grows, cells that have less potential to change also get a chance to change. So the higher alpha is, the more random spots appear in the landscape.</p>

<p>GRAFIEK ALPHA OVER TIJD MET FRACTIAL DIMENSION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is striking in the graph is that when alpha is very small (0 - 0.5), a large fractal dimension is immediately visible (~ 1.5). This dimension hardly grows when time steps are taken. If alpha is larger (1 or&gt; 1), there is a very low fractal dimension (~ 0.7) at the start and this grows over time, the curve is logaritmic. This is understandable because when alpha gets bigger there is more randomness and this is not favorable for a large fractal growth.</p>

<h1>Varying the neighbourhood size</h1>
<p>The size of the neighbourhood has been varied. When all the cells have no neighbours, all the transition potentials are zero and thus the result is completely random. However, applying a neighbourhood with a radius of 1 cell, results in the formation of clusters of urban activity. The size of the clusters increases with increasing neighbourhood size.</p>
