<h1>Varying the neighbourhood size</h1>
<p>The size of the neighbourhood has been varied. When all the cells have no neighbours, all the transition potentials are zero and thus the result is completely random. However, applying a neighbourhood with a radius of 1 cell, results in the formation of clusters of urban activity. The size of the clusters increases with increasing neighbourhood size.</p>
