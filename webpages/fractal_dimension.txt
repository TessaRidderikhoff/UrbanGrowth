<p><strong>Alpha parameter exper</strong><strong>iment</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alpha determens if there is randomness in the model. This means that a cell that does not have the highest potential can still be selected to change. In this way randomness comes into the model.</p>
<p>When alpha is for example 0 there is no randomness in the model. There are only large blocks with the same kind. When apha grows, cells that have less potential to change also get a chance to change. So the higher alpha is, the more random spots appear in the landscape.</p>

<p>GRAFIEK ALPHA OVER TIJD MET FRACTIAL DIMENSION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is striking in the graph is that when alpha is very small (0 - 0.5), a large fractal dimension is immediately visible (~ 1.5). This dimension hardly grows when time steps are taken. If alpha is larger (1 or&gt; 1), there is a very low fractal dimension (~ 0.7) at the start and this grows over time, the curve is logaritmic. This is understandable because when alpha gets bigger there is more randomness and this is not favorable for a large fractal growth.</p>

<h1>Fractal dimension</h1>
<p>The fractal dimension is a measure for the degree of complexity. It is the ratio of the change in detail in a pattern to the change in scale. It can be estimated using the following equation:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap">lg<em>B<sub>t</sub></em>=<em>c+D</em>lg<em>r</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this equation&nbsp;<em>D</em> is the fractal dimension, <em>c</em> a constant and <em>B<sub>t</sub> </em>is the total number of occupied cells within an area with a radius <em>r</em>. To determine the fractal dimension of a city, the total urbanized area within a given radius of the centre is calculated for several radii of increasing length. Then, regression analysis can be applied. The slope of the fitted linear line plot is equal to the fractal dimension.</p>
<p>The fractal dimensions have been estimated for several cities. Values around 1.7 were found (Anas et al, 1998).</p>
