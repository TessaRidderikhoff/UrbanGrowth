<p><strong>River experiment</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal: </strong></p>
<p>1. See if there is "life" around the river;</p>
<p>2. See if there will be two different sides with low neighborhood size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have initialized a vertical river in the middle of the grid that runs from top to bottom. The river is two sites wide.</p>
<p>Initialization: we are still starting in the middle of the grid, near the river.</p>
<p>Life around the river: After a number of time steps it is clearly visible that houses are being built along the entire river. A few times later, it is clearly visible that more and more houses are being built along the river.</p>
<p>Different areas: it is clearly visible that there is no interaction between the two areas. This is because the river is too wide and we have conducted this expiriment with a low neigborhood size. This situation is comparable to "the IJ" in Amsterdam, which separates Amsterdam center and Amsterdam Noord.</p>
