<p><strong>Alpha parameter exper</strong><strong>iment</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alpha determens if there is randomness in the model. This means that a cell that does not have the highest potential can still be selected to change. In this way randomness comes into the model.</p>
<p>When alpha is for example 0 there is no randomness in the model. There are only large blocks with the same kind. When apha grows, cells that have less potential to change also get a chance to change. So the higher alpha is, the more random spots appear in the landscape.</p>

<p>GRAFIEK ALPHA OVER TIJD MET FRACTIAL DIMENSION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is striking in the graph is that when alpha is very small (0 - 0.5), a large fractal dimension is immediately visible (~ 1.5). This dimension hardly grows when time steps are taken. If alpha is larger (1 or&gt; 1), there is a very low fractal dimension (~ 0.7) at the start and this grows over time, the curve is logaritmic. This is understandable because when alpha gets bigger there is more randomness and this is not favorable for a large fractal growth.</p>

<p><strong>River experiment</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal: </strong></p>
<p>1. See if there is "life" around the river;</p>
<p>2. See if there will be two different sides with low neighborhood size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have initialized a vertical river in the middle of the grid that runs from top to bottom. The river is two sites wide.</p>
<p>Initialization: we are still starting in the middle of the grid, near the river.</p>
<p>Life around the river: After a number of time steps it is clearly visible that houses are being built along the entire river. A few times later, it is clearly visible that more and more houses are being built along the river.</p>
<p>Different areas: it is clearly visible that there is no interaction between the two areas. This is because the river is too wide and we have conducted this expiriment with a low neigborhood size. This situation is comparable to "the IJ" in Amsterdam, which separates Amsterdam center and Amsterdam Noord.</p>
