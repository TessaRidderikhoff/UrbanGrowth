<p><strong>Alpha parameter exper</strong><strong>iment</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alpha determens if there is randomness in the model. This means that a cell that does not have the highest potential can still be selected to change. In this way randomness comes into the model.</p>
<p>When alpha is for example 0 there is no randomness in the model. There are only large blocks with the same kind. When apha grows, cells that have less potential to change also get a chance to change. So the higher alpha is, the more random spots appear in the landscape.</p>

<p>GRAFIEK ALPHA OVER TIJD MET FRACTIAL DIMENSION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is striking in the graph is that when alpha is very small (0 - 0.5), a large fractal dimension is immediately visible (~ 1.5). This dimension hardly grows when time steps are taken. If alpha is larger (1 or&gt; 1), there is a very low fractal dimension (~ 0.7) at the start and this grows over time, the curve is logaritmic. This is understandable because when alpha gets bigger there is more randomness and this is not favorable for a large fractal growth.</p>

<h1>The model</h1>
<p>The implemented model, which was developed by R. White and G. Engelen (1993), simulates urban land use over time using cellular automata. The specifications of the model are given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The model consists of a grid of cells, where the state of a cell represents a type of land use. The possible states of the cells are vacant (V), housing (H), industrial (I) and commercial (C).<!--en eventueel river (R)--></li>
<li>At each iteration the growth rate determines the number of cells that will be converted to another state. <!--The growth rate is set to ???? --> The ratio in which cells are transformed to commerce, industry and housing is 1:4:7.</li>
<li>A cell's neighbourhood is the set of cells within a circle with a specified radius. <!--In this model a radius of ???? is used. --></li>
<li>A hierarchal order is applied to the different states. This order is as follows: vacant (lowest state), housing, industry and commerce (highest state). A cell is allowed to change from a lower state to a higher state, but not the other way around.</li>
<li>At each iteration in the simulation, the transition potentials for all transitions allowed by the hierarchy are calculated using the following formula:
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap"><em>P<sub>i,j</sub></em>=<em>S</em>(1+</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap"><!--UB--><span style="font-family: symbol;">&aring;</span><em><sub>h,k,d</sub>m<sub>k,d</sub>I<sub>h,d</sub></em>)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
where <em>P<sub>i,j</sub></em> is the transition potential from state <em>i</em> to state <em>j</em>; <br /> <em>m<sub>k,d</sub></em> is the weighting parameter assigned to cells in state <em>k</em> in distance zone <em>d</em>; <br /> <em>h</em> is the index of cells within a given distance zone; <br /> <em>I<sub>h,d</sub></em> is equal to 1 if the state of cell <em>h = k</em>, otherwise it equals 0; <br /> <em>S</em> is a stochastic disturbance term and is given by:
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap"><em>S</em>=1+(<span style="font-family: symbol;">-</span>ln<em>R</em>)<sup><span style="font-family: symbol;">a</span></sup></td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Here <em>R</em> is a random number between 0 and 1. The parameter <em>&alpha;</em> determines the size of the stochastic perturbation.</li>
<li>The transition potentials are used to determine which cells are transformed to other states. At each iteration, the cells having the highest transition potentials for a certain state will be converted to that state. However, if a certain cell belongs to the group of cells with the highest transition potentials for more than one state, then it is stochastically determined which transition takes place. In compensation, a cell having a lower transition potential will be converted to the other state, so that the correct number of transformations occur.</li>
